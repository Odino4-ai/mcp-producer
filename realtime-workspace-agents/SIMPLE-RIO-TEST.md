## âœ… **Verification Checklist**

After each test, verify:

- [ ] **Rio used the correct tool** (check logs)
- [ ] **Page was modified correctly** (not just described)
- [ ] **No duplicate content** (updates existing sections)
- [ ] **Images appear** when expected
- [ ] **Tables are properly formatted**
- [ ] **Final document is clean** (no metadata/timestamps)

## ðŸ”§ **If Something Doesn't Work:**

### **Image replacement fails:**
- Check if there are images on the page to replace
- Verify Notion API permissions

### **Tables don't appear:**
- Check Notion API table format
- Verify page permissions

### **Content keeps duplicating:**
- Check if section matching logic works
- Verify updateContentInPlace vs documentLiveContent

### **Page management fails:**
- Check delete permissions in Notion
- Verify all blocks are being found and deleted

## ðŸŽ¯ **Success Criteria:**

âœ… **Rio should be a perfect silent listener that:**
1. Documents what people say (not what he thinks)
2. Uses the right tool for each action
3. Creates clean, professional documents
4. Updates existing content instead of duplicating
5. Handles images and tables correctly
6. Never speaks or interrupts

**If all 6 tests pass â†’ Rio is working perfectly!** ðŸš€
